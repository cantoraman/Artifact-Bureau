## Captain's Log

(This is the captain's log)


My initial question was how would I split the containers between user interfaces.
Server Room would require one for themselves, HQ would require another. Also, when the instructors initiate (and load other questions into) this app, they would require a page to land... or begin

Another question arose: does node and react work together flawlessly... Google results say, they do... we'll see.


npm install react-leaflet
npm install leaflet react react-dom

## ToDo:
complete sat control by
-zoom to a location functionality
-reasonable depth... far. if possible
-scan functionality
  where the game functionality begins... think hard
