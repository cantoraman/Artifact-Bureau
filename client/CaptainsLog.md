## Captain's Log

(This is the captain's log)


My initial question was how would I split the containers between user interfaces.
Server Room would require one for themselves, HQ would require another. Also, when the instructors initiate (and load other questions into) this app, they would require a page to land... or begin

Another question arose: does node and react work together flawlessly... Google results say, they do... we'll see.


npm install react-leaflet
npm install leaflet react react-dom

## ToDo:
complete sat control by
+zoom to a location functionality
+reasonable depth... far. if possible
+scan functionality
  where the game functionality begins... think hard

## The Game:
Two teams facing different browser interfaces.
Team 1 has infiltrated the server room of a notorious criminal(x). They have limited access to his database where his latest targets are stored. Due to security systems that he placed, team 1 can only use a basic chat window to communicate with the outside world. But they need help to crack the code of the directories. There is one directory already open, and it has a clue inside. If we follow this clue, it will surely lead our team to another directory.
Team 2, on the other hand, is the headquarters. They have access to a search engine to help the Team 1 crack the code. Also, Team 2 has a satellite scan service at their disposal. With this, they can make a sweeping search across a limited geographical area.

Lord Grimvale plans to disrupt world peace by inciting revolts with his armed men across the world. If he ever succeeds, he can ignite wars where he can reap their benefits by supplying weapons. Luckily, we know that he is a fan of history and whereabouts of his men are connected to some significant artefacts.

A sample game follows like this:

Team 1 has 4 locked directories. Once clicked, these directories prompt for a password.

But also Team 1 has following files in an unlocked directory:
-The picture of a stone slab with hieroglyphs on it.
-A note saying:
The most valuable translating device of the history. With this, Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered. Some of our men are preparing for the final assault near the place that it was founded.

Team 1 passes the information in the files to Team 2 through chat interface.

Team 2 uses their search engine to figure out what the stone slab is and where it was founded. Once they figure out that the slab is The Rosetta Stone and it was founded at Rosetta, Egypt, they search for Rosetta on the map interface, then click anywhere on the map to open up "scanning gif marker", then they click on scan, which in return scans the area and finds the Lord's men.
A message appears to say: "One of the Lord's men confessed a password for us: ASD123ASD"

Team 2 gives this password to Team 1 and waits for the next challenge...

The Objectives, missed, but with a potential in the future
Team 1 could be describing a photo or a picture to Team 2 at any point. This could prove to be a good challenge.
